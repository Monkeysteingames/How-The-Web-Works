What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

The browser sends a request to the computer cache to see if we've visited this website, if not it will go through the router and then to my ISP. If the website is not located by the time we search our ISP
the search gets sent a DNS sever. In this particular case the website was found but redirected to a new url that isn't the domain name that was looked up.
